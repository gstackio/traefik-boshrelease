    description: |
      Hostname to query when querying the Traefik frontend.

      When 'traefik.acme.enabled' is true for the Traefik instance group
      pointed by the 'traefik' Bosh link above, then this 'frontend_hostname'
      must be a DNS anme for which Traefik will be able to generate a valid
      Let's Encrypt certificate.

      When 'frontend_hostname' is a DNS name for which no Let's Encrypt
      certificate can be provisioned (like 'mockbin.example.com'), then Let's
      Encrypt must be deactivated.
    default: mockbin.example.com
