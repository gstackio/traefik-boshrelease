properties:
  frontend_hostname:
    description: |
      Hostname to query when querying the Traefik frontend.

      When 'traefik.acme.enabled' is true for the Traefik instance group
      pointed by the 'traefik' Bosh link above, then this 'frontend_hostname'
      must be a DNS anme for which Traefik will be able to generate a valid
      Let's Encrypt certificate.

      When 'frontend_hostname' is a DNS name for which no Let's Encrypt
      certificate can be provisioned (like 'mockbin.example.com'), then Let's
      Encrypt must be deactivated.
    default: mockbin.example.com

  mockbin_backend_port:
    description: |
      The TCP port on which the 'mockbin' HTTP server implementation will
      listen for web requests.

      For the sake of properly testing the Traefik proxy, this job will run an
      instance of a very simple 'mockbin' HTTP server implementation, which
      will act as a server backend for the Traefik acting as a proxy.

      This simple 'mockbin' implementation will run on the instance (VM) where
      the smoke tests are running. Thus operators should ensure that the
      Traefik proxy can reach to the smoke tests instance through the network
      on the specified TCP port.
    default: 8080
